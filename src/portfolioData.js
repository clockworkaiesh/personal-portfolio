    description: "I worked as a Frontend Developer on Bubsy, a decentralized application (DApp) designed to bring transparency and insights into crypto activity. I built and optimized the Integrity Bubble Map with React, Next.js, PixiJS, and D3-force, enabling smooth WebGL interactions like zoom, pan, drag with physics, scam/volatile token filtering, and dynamic wallet visibility, all tied into Redux state management. Beyond visualization, I contributed to core web3 integrations, including wallet connections, wallet PnL tracking, smart pairs analytics, and integrity analysis tools. I also developed Bubsy's animated landing experience with GSAP, featuring scroll-triggered 3D transitions, video backgrounds, and performance-focused animation lifecycles. My role combined interactive data visualization, web3 feature development, and motion design, helping deliver a polished, high-performance DApp experience",
